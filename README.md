## Surface Heat Island Effect wrt Air Pollution

Summer             |  Winter

UHI median varying from (2 C to 3.5 C ) in summers.  |  UHI varying from (3.5 degrees to 4.2 C ) in winters.
Greater spread in UHI, especially in 25–50 and 50–75 µg/m³ bins — more variability in heat patterns.  | Spread (IQR) is relatively tight in higher NO₂ bins — suggests more consistent UHI under heavily polluted winter conditions.​
Factors like stronger winds and cloud cover variability in summer might reduce the coupling between air pollution and surface heating.​  |  Possibly due to temperature inversions and stagnant air, pollutants and heat get trapped, especially in dense urban settings.​
